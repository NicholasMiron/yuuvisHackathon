 The Issue:
For Applicants: Resume creation is a time consuming, process that should be simplified to focus on whatâ€™s important. Not the styling. Recruiters have an influx of resumes, an efficient process to parse through those documents will save them a ton of time and allow them to identify qualified applicants.
Our solution:
Applicant: Standard JSON-based resume which allows for an automatically created and formatted resume. Both get stored in the Yuuvis API. Recruiter: With hundreds of submitted applications to look through, Yuuvis API and document metadata allows for easy querying, filtering, and retrieval of documents.
How our project works: 
1: Applicant: Fill out resume information. We store this information as a JSON styled document and get it converted to a PDF. Both documents are then stored using the Yuuvis API.
2: Recruiter: Filter resumes to find qualified docs. With hundreds of submitted applications to look through, Yuuvis API and document metadata allows for easy querying, filtering, and retrieval of documents.
